# SocketAdventure

A Small Single-player Online Role-Playing Game

You'll need two terminal windows. In one, type:

```
$ python serve.py 50000
```

In the other, type
```
$ python client.py 50000
```

Then explore a Five-room world of fun and adventure.

Note that `50000` specifies the port number for the server. You can safely choose any number between 8000 and 50000, but you have to use the same number when calling the client that you used to create the server.
